        <p>The Stars in the night sky for most, would be the embodiement of mystery. However, for my people, they were a symbol of beauty and hope... Within our darkest time. We would look up to the sky and witness ever-expanding beauty and with hopes to visit them... to discover them, however, this beauty blinded us as my kind never thought that something else would be discovering us!
        <br>
        What we thought were Stars, was infact multiple lights of Evil. The Sky would thunder as thousands of Starships had entered our atmosphere, with each Ship breaking the Sky, the sound echoed as if it was Wardrums beating. The Stars were no longer a symbol of beauty and hope but a reminder of death.
        <br> 
        The screams of innocents echoed throughout the lands, some cut shorter then others as sounds of explosions came straight after, ending the haunting cry. For as long as me and my people could remember, the Stars would bring us hope and so we worshipped them but how can we pray for help when our hope is whats killing us?
        <br>
        I could feel the ground shake, the sky breaking and so I ran to find a place to either hide or die.  Throughtout my search, I found a what was once a place of healing become a  ruined building but maybe it could save one more life. I sprinted towards this Ruin and waited for the End. Scared and alone, I didn't know what else to do but sit and wait, I began to wonder if this was all a dream but how could this of been a dream, when this was nothing more then a living Nightmare.
