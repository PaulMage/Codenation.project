<p>Throught my life I was told one thing; That War is the way of life. My people worshipped bloodshed, the lived to die in combat and no matter who you were, you a born to pick up arms and die in glory. My home is a World where War is treated like a sport , that only the best warriors are hailed as Kings and Queens. Through out this planet live only nine tribes that all have mastered different ways of combat, My father is a leader of a tribe and respected by all however, he lost all repsect for me.
<br>
During a fight, he forced me to call up arms against a nearby tribe but I refused. I never wanted to fight. During the training spars, I was always beaten by one warrior, she then went on to gain a blessing from my father to become his Daughter in Arms. I had enough of this all, my father then Outcasted me after I tried to argue but it fell on deaf ears as he was blinded by blood. He striped me of title of Son in Blood and my name.
<br>
I ran away from this life. I decided to hide out in the open fields amongst the sky and for the first time I felt peace though that was soon to change when a life kepted getting closer to me and I soon realised it was flying. Never in my years I have seen such a fasinating piece of work. I waited abit and watched it land in front of my eyes and witnessed the unknown open up revealing beings but not like us, smaller then me but they seem to be wearing some other worldly armour and weapons. We spoke and I told them the situation, they seemed to be surprised and so I questioned why, they explained that this is the first time they have ever spoken to my kind and that out there beyond on the lights in the sky was more. I wanted to see this, to get away from this cursed planet and so I asked to join them, they paused and nodded but one turned around and told me 
<br>
"Be prepared for your life was about to change"</p>
